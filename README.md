# SvelteKit with Svelte 5 (runes) with PocketBase Starter Template

I'm a newish JavaScript developer and I found CSR, SSR, authentication, hooks etc all very confusing.  This is the starter template I wish I'd been able to find in 2022, only with Runes. 

- Svelte 5 in runes mode
- PocketBase for authentication (CSR and SSR)
- PocketBase realtime example, see [/verify](https://github.com/adamshand/sveltekit-pocketbase-auth/blob/main/src/routes/(auth)/verify/%2Bpage.svelte)
